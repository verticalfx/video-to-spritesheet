# Usage
## Running the regular script
Running the regular script will process videos and create spritesheets for each one and
then upload them to roblox.

## Running the uploading images to Roblox script
Running the uploading images to Roblox script will only upload a folder of images to Roblox.

# Output
- The script will process each video in the input folder and create a spritesheet for each one

- For each video, it extracts the frames and saves them in the results directory with a timestamped subfolder

- Frames are combined into sprite sheets saved in the sheets subdirectory within each video's results folder

- The script gives you the option to upload the spritesheets to Roblox and automatically generates a luau file with the urls of the spritesheets

# Special Notes
- The script will not overwrite existing spritesheets

- The script supports alpha channel (transparency) - it will preserve the alpha channel if your input video has it supported
